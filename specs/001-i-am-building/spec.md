**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building bicycle store called Contoso Bicycles to sell bikes. I want it to looks something like the UI mock up images attached to this prompt. Use mock up images and details similar to what is in the UI"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints

   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a shopper I want to browse Contoso Bicycles online, view product listings and details, add bikes to a cart, and complete a simple checkout so I can buy a bike that looks like the provided UI mockups.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a visitor lands on the homepage, When they view the hero and product sections, Then they see featured bikes, categories tabs, and product cards similar to the mockup.
2. Given a user selects a product card, When they open the product detail, Then they see images, price, short description, and an Add to Cart control.
3. Given a user has items in the cart, When they go to checkout, Then they can enter shipping details and place an order (simple flow stubbed for MVP).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no products in a category? Show an empty state with a helpful message.
- How does the system handle image load failures? Show a placeholder image.
- What if the cart submission fails? Show an error and allow retry.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The site MUST display a homepage with a large hero banner and primary call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Shop Bikes").
- FR-002: The site MUST show a product listing section with tabs/categories (All Products, Mountain, Road, Electric, Kids, Accessories).
- FR-003: Each product card MUST include: image, title, price, badge (optional: "New" or discount), and an Add to Cart affordance.
- FR-004: Clicking a product card MUST open a product detail view showing multiple images (carousel or gallery), price, short description, and Add to Cart.
- FR-005: The site MUST provide a cart page showing items, quantities, subtotal, and a Checkout button.
- FR-006: The checkout flow MUST collect basic shipping information and allow placing an order (can be a stub for MVP, but must return success/failure states).
- FR-007: The site MUST include a top navigation with brand name "Contoso Bicycles", search field, and a cart icon.
- FR-008: The UI MUST include footer links and copyright similar to the mockup.
- FR-009: Images used in the UI MUST have alt text for accessibility.

*Ambiguities / Assumptions*
- FR-010: Payment processing method is unspecified ‚Äî [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Do we integrate a payment provider for MVP or simulate payment?]
- FR-011: Authentication is unspecified ‚Äî assume guest checkout supported; [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is account creation required?]

*Decisions / Defaults for MVP*
- FR-010 (Payment): For the MVP the payment flow will be simulated (no real payment provider). The system MUST return clear success and failure responses for the simulated payment so the UI can surface appropriate messages. Integration with a real payment provider (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) is a follow-up task.
- FR-011 (Authentication): Support guest checkout for MVP. Account creation is optional and out of scope for MVP; if implemented later, it should be a progressive enhancement (allow users to create an account after purchase).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- Product: id, title, description, price, images[], category, badges (new/discount)
- Cart: items[{productId, quantity}], subtotal
- Order (MVP stub): orderId, items, shippingDetails, total, status

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous where possible
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (visible pages and flows)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded to storefront browsing and simple checkout
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

### Final review
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (payment and auth defaults chosen)
- [x] Review checklist passed

## Execution Status

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [ ] Review checklist passed

**Status**: Spec marked complete for MVP planning. Payment is simulated and guest checkout is supported; follow-up work required for real payments and account management.

---

**Notes**: This spec describes a minimal public storefront (browse, product detail, cart, checkout stub) that matches the visual layout from the provided UI mockups. Clarify payment and authentication decisions before implementation planning.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios

- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
